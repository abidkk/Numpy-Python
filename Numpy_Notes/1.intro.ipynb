    "# Key Features\n",
    "1.\tEfficient Array Operations:\n",
    "o\tNumPy arrays, called ndarray, are more efficient than Python lists for numerical data because they are stored in contiguous memory blocks, making computation faster and more memory-efficient.\n",
    "o\tIt supports n-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "2.\tBroadcasting:\n",
    "o\tEnables element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes without explicitly replicating the data.\n",
    "3.\tMathematical Functions:\n",
    "o\tProvides functions for a wide range of mathematical operations, such as trigonometry, algebra, statistics, and linear algebra.\n",
    "4.\tInteroperability:\n",
    "o\tEasily integrates with other scientific libraries like SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.\n",
    "o\tCan handle data from sources like text files, CSVs, or databases.\n",
    "5.\tRandom Number Generation:\n",
    "o\tComes with a robust random module for generating random numbers, sampling, and performing simulations.\n",
    "6.\tManipulation of Arrays:\n",
    "o\tProvides tools for reshaping, slicing, stacking, splitting, and indexing arrays efficiently.\n"
